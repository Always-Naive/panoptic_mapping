# This Service can be used to request labels for a given camera pose in the semantic map
# The pose can either be infered from the given sensor frame and timestamp OR can be provided in the T_C_M transform.
# If available, a depth image can be provided which improves accuracy and calculation speed

# Flag if depth image is provided that can be used for the lookup
bool use_depth
# Flag if custom tf is provided for the map lookup.
# If false, transform will be calculated using tf lookups from the sensor frame
bool use_provided_tf
# Depth image <Optional>
sensor_msgs/Image depth
# Transform <Optional>
geometry_msgs/Transform T_C_M
# Name of the sensor frame
string sensor_frame
# Uncertainty Method that should be used. Choose from: <'uncertainty', 'voxel_entropy', 'voxel_probability'>
string uncertainty_method
# Timestamp for when the tf should be looked up <optional>
